# Awesome Ethereum Proofs [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Source code verification proofs for the earliest contracts on Ethereum (2015-2017), created through compiler archaeology and bytecode matching.

Each proof independently compiles the original source code with the exact compiler version used at deployment time, producing a byte-for-byte match against on-chain bytecode. These are contracts too old for Etherscan's automated verification tools.

## How It Works

1. **Bytecode analysis** - Identify compiler patterns in the on-chain bytecode (constructor shape, memory allocation patterns, function selector dispatch)
2. **Source reconstruction** - Reverse-engineer or locate the original source code from GitHub repos, gists, or archive.org
3. **Compiler matching** - Try every compiler version from the deployment era until we get a byte-for-byte match
4. **Publication** - Each proof is published as an open-source repo with a reproducible verification script

## Notable Findings

- **Vitalik's Currency Token** was compiled from `currency.se` (Serpent), not `currency.sol` (Solidity). The `ethereum/dapp-bin` repo had both implementations side by side. [Vitalik confirmed on Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1rmheom/) with "Nice find!"
- **First Executable Contract** was compiled with soljson v0.1.1, the earliest available Solidity compiler release, just 8 days after Ethereum mainnet launch.

## Why This Matters

Most contracts from 2015-2016 are unverified on Etherscan because:
- The compiler versions are too old for automated tools
- Some contracts used languages Etherscan doesn't support (Serpent, LLL)
- Source code was never published or was lost

These proofs preserve the technical history of Ethereum's earliest smart contracts.
